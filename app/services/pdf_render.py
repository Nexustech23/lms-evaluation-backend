# Sync API, not async — the async API launches Chromium via
# asyncio.create_subprocess_exec on whatever event loop is currently running,
# which fails with NotImplementedError under uvicorn's default Windows loop
# (uvicorn forces WindowsSelectorEventLoopPolicy, which has no subprocess
# transport; only WindowsProactorEventLoopPolicy supports it). The sync API
# manages its browser process through Playwright's own driver connection
# instead, so it's unaffected by the calling loop's policy — callers must
# invoke this via asyncio.to_thread(), never awaited directly.
